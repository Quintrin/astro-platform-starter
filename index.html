      <h1>Marine Risk, Structured for Insurer-Ready Review</h1>
      <p>
        We prepare operational and compliance data so marine risks are presented
        clearly, consistently, and defensibly — before they reach underwriters.

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section>
      <h2>Structure Determines Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        Marine operators are often penalized not for unsafe operations, but for
        fragmented submissions, inconsistent documentation, and unclear exposure narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insurance markets price uncertainty aggressively. Structure reduces it.
      </p>

    <!-- WHAT WE DO -->
    <section>
      <h2>Independent Marine Risk Structuring</h2>
      <p>
        Quintrin organizes vessel, route, compliance, and operational data into
        standardized formats insurers and brokers can assess efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not insure, underwrite, or broker risk.  
        We prepare it.
      </p>
